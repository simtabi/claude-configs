# ai-configurator

Version your `~/.claude/` directory without versioning your caches.
Author rules once, ship them to every AI coding agent you use.

`ai-configurator` symlinks a content directory you control into
`~/.claude/` at the paths [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
expects, ships opinionated "decision packs" that bake in
content-filter-safe practices, and gives you one verb each for
setting up a fresh machine and dropping cross-vendor rules into any
project repo. Wired adapters: claude-code, aider, cursor, windsurf,
copilot, codex, cline.

```bash
pip install ai-configurator
ai-configurator bootstrap        # validate + init + install + doctor, one shot
```

## Why it exists

`~/.claude/` is a mixed bag:

| Kind | Examples | Worth versioning? |
|---|---|---|
| **Config** | `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `prompts/`, `projects/*/memory/`, `plugins/blocklist.json` | yes |
| **Opt-in** | `sessions/`, `history.jsonl` | maybe (grow fast) |
| **Runtime** | `paste-cache/`, `file-history/`, `tasks/`, `todos/`, `cache/`, `plans/`, `statsig/`, `telemetry/` | no |
| **Secret** | `.credentials.json`, SSH keys, `.npmrc`, `.netrc`, `.env*` | never |

Putting the whole directory under git means versioning hundreds of MB
of caches and fighting `.gitignore` every time Claude Code adds a new
runtime path. `ai-configurator` solves this by keeping your
canonical config in a content directory (default
`~/.config/claude-config/content/`), symlinked into `~/.claude/` at
the right paths. Edit a file in `~/.claude/` and you're editing the
content dir; commit and push to share across machines.

The classification above is enforced by the install command. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full table.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install ai-configurator
# or:  pipx install ai-configurator
# or:  uv tool install ai-configurator
```

Requirements: Python 3.10+, `git` on `PATH` (only for `init` and
`sync`). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (Windows symlinks need
either Administrator or Developer Mode). Full install notes in
[`docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md).

---

## One-liner install (any platform)

If you have neither `pip` nor `ai-configurator` yet, use the
[`get-installer`](https://github.com/simtabi/get-installer) bootstrap
(a sibling Simtabi project):

```bash
# POSIX (macOS / Linux / WSL / Git-Bash)
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://get.simtabi.com/install.sh)" -- \
  --product ai-configurator

# PowerShell (Windows)
irm https://get.simtabi.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

`get-installer` is registry-driven, version-aware, journals every
action for clean rollback on failure, and refuses to run as root. It
previously shipped inside this repo at `installer/`; it now lives as
its own project so other Simtabi tools (and third parties) can vendor
it. Full design + threat model: <https://github.com/simtabi/get-installer>.

## Quick start guide and usage

### Getting started

```bash
ai-configurator bootstrap
```

Runs validate → init → install → doctor with prompts. Idempotent:
safe to re-run on a machine that's already set up. Pass `--push` to
also commit + push the content dir to its remote, `--remote URL` to
configure `origin` on a fresh machine, `--dry-run` to see what would
happen.

To point it at a different content or target directory (CI, an
ephemeral checkout), set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_CONTENT_DIR` and
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_TARGET` before running it.

### Usage

Once installed:

```bash
ai-configurator status              # what's tracked, what's not, git state
ai-configurator list                # grouped view of everything in content
ai-configurator view CLAUDE.md      # print a tracked file
ai-configurator sync -m "tighten X" # commit changes in the content dir
```

---

## Multi-vendor: one rules source, every AI agent

`ai-configurator` ships adapters for seven CLI-based AI coding agents.
Authored rules live once in your content dir; each vendor's expected
file format gets generated on demand.

```bash
# Compose the cross-vendor canonical from CLAUDE.md + decision packs
ai-configurator compose-agents-md

# Drop AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .clinerules, and
# .github/copilot-instructions.md into a project repo in one shot
ai-configurator project-install ~/code/my-app \
    --vendor=aider --vendor=cursor --vendor=windsurf \
    --vendor=copilot --vendor=codex --vendor=cline
```

The supported vendors and their conventions:

| Vendor | Project file | Global target |
|---|---|---|
| claude-code | (none) | `~/.claude/` |
| aider | `AGENTS.md` | (none) |
| codex | `AGENTS.md` (native) | `~/.codex/instructions/` |
| cursor | `.cursorrules` | `~/.cursor/rules/` |
| cline | `.clinerules` | (none) |
| windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | (none) |
| copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | (none) |

`install` also writes the canonical `AGENTS.md` into each configured
vendor's global target (currently only cursor benefits). Existing
per-project files are never overwritten without `--force`.

## Decisions: bundled global rules

`ai-configurator` ships **decision packs**: opinionated bundles
of `CLAUDE.md` fragments and slash commands that bake in proven
patterns. Two are auto-applied on `init` (skip with `--no-decisions`):

| Pack | What it ships |
|---|---|
| `script-generation-pattern` | Slash command + `CLAUDE.md` fragment that tells the model to use a generator script for many-file / content-filter-risky tasks. |
| `fetch-canonical-pattern` | `/fetch-canonical` slash command + `CLAUDE.md` fragment for canonical-file downloads (license, code of conduct, etc.) that route URL → disk and never through the response stream. |

```bash
ai-configurator decisions list                # show all bundled packs
ai-configurator decisions show <name>         # print pack details
ai-configurator decisions apply <name>        # copy into content dir (non-clobbering)
```

[`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md).

## The `fetch` command + canonical-file pattern

Asking Claude Code to add a `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, or any
other well-known upstream text often trips a content-filter policy
block. The model's file-write tool streams the body through the
response, and the filter watches that stream.

`ai-configurator fetch` routes the bytes URL → disk via Python's
stdlib (`urllib.request`). The response only contains the metadata:

```bash
ai-configurator fetch https://example.com/license.txt ./LICENSE
# path=…  bytes=11357  lines=202  sha256=…  status=created  first_line=Apache License
```

Atomic write, idempotent, HTTPS-only by default, size cap (1 MiB),
UTF-8 validation, optional `--expect-sha256`. The bundled
`fetch-canonical-pattern` decision pack teaches the model to use this
verb (or `curl -o` as a fallback) automatically.

---

## Multi-machine setup

Push the content dir to a private git repo from machine A, then on
machine B:

```bash
pip install ai-configurator
git clone git@github.com:you/my-claude-content.git ~/.config/claude-config/content
ai-configurator bootstrap
```

The on-disk path stays `~/.config/claude-config/` (not
`ai-configurator/`) so existing installs keep working. The
package name is what changed.
